<h1>ADC</h1>
<h2>What is this component</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A 12-bit ADC is an approximation method for Analog to Digital Converter. There are totally 10 multiplexed channels with 8 external channels which can measure signals from analog input and 2 internal sources. If the input voltage is beyond the thresholds, the feature of Analog Watchdog will detect the outranged signal. An interrupt will then be generated to warn that the input voltage is higher or lower then the thresholds. There are three conversion modes to translate a data from analog to digital. Various channels of the A/D conversion can be operated in one shot, continuous and discontinuous mode. A left-aligned or right-aligned 16-bit data register is provided to store the data after conversion.</li>
